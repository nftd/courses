Executive Summary: Cars with automatic transmission have less mpg than cars with manual transmission. Cars with more weight are likely to be "AT" so there is no evidence which is the variable that is making a car with a high mpg: the weight or the transimission.

Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
mtcars1 <- data.frame(mtcars$mpg,
                      factor(mtcars$cyl)
                      ,mtcars$disp
                      ,mtcars$hp
                      ,mtcars$drat
                      ,mtcars$wt
                      ,mtcars$qsec
                      ,factor(mtcars$vs)
                      ,factor(mtcars$am)
                      ,factor(mtcars$gear)
                      ,factor(mtcars$carb))
colnames(mtcars1)[1] = "mpg"
colnames(mtcars1)[2] = "cyl"
colnames(mtcars1)[3] = "disp"
colnames(mtcars1)[4] = "hp"
colnames(mtcars1)[5] = "drat"
colnames(mtcars1)[6] = "wt"
colnames(mtcars1)[7] = "qsec"
colnames(mtcars1)[8] = "vs"
colnames(mtcars1)[9] = "am"
colnames(mtcars1)[10] = "gear"
colnames(mtcars1)[11] = "carb"
fit <- lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars1)
```

Linear model coefficients

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(fit)$coef
```
YES. Looking the T-test for am1, the difference is significant between each transmition. (check graph 1 in appendix)

"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
```{r}
summary(lm (mpg ~ ., data = mtcars1))$coefficients
```
Exploring the variables, it seems that 'hp' and 'wt'can influence the mpg so we will look those variables.

Test hp
```{r, echo=FALSE}
s<- split(mtcars1, mtcars1$am)
aut<- s[[1]]
man<- s[[2]]
lmBothHp <- lm(mtcars1$mpg ~ mtcars1$hp + mtcars1$am + mtcars1$am*mtcars1$hp)
summary(lmBothHp)$coefficients
```
The coefficient mtcars1$hp:mtcars1$am1 shows that both variables not explain the mpg. (Check Graph 2 in appendix)

Test wt
```{r, echo=FALSE}
s<- split(mtcars1, mtcars1$am)
aut<- s[[1]]
man<- s[[2]]
lmBoth <- lm(mtcars1$mpg ~ mtcars1$wt + mtcars1$am + mtcars1$am*mtcars1$wt)
summary(lmBoth)$coefficients
```
The coefficient mtcars1$wt:mtcars1$am shows that both variables explain significantly the mpg (check Graph 3 in appendix). Cars with more weight have an automatic transmition.

Cuantify Residuals (normal distribution)
```{r}
summary(lmBoth)$sigma
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
unstandardizedResiduals <- resid(lmBoth)
standardizedResiduals <- (unstandardizedResiduals - mean(unstandardizedResiduals)) / sd(unstandardizedResiduals)
probDist <- pnorm(standardizedResiduals)
plot(ppoints(length(standardizedResiduals)), sort(probDist), main = "PP Plot", xlab = "Observed Probability", ylab = "Expected Probability")
abline(0,1)
```
Residuals are within a normal distribution

Appendix

```{r, echo=FALSE}
require(stats); require(graphics)
boxplot(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars1,
        xlab = "Transmission", ylab = "MPG",
        main = "Graph 1", varwidth = TRUE, col = "lightgray")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(mtcars1$hp,mtcars1$mpg,pch=19,main = "Graph 2",sub = "red = aut, black = man")
points(mtcars1$hp,mtcars1$mpg,pch=19,col=((mtcars1$am=="0")*1+1))
abline(c(lmBothHp$coeff[1],lmBothHp$coeff[2]),col="red",lwd=3)
abline(c(lmBothHp$coeff[1] + lmBothHp$coeff[3],lmBothHp$coeff[2] +lmBothHp$coeff[4]),col="black",lwd=3)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(mtcars1$wt,mtcars1$mpg,pch=19,main = "Graph 3",sub = "red = aut, black = man")
points(mtcars1$wt,mtcars1$mpg,pch=19,col=((mtcars1$am=="0")*1+1))
abline(c(lmBoth$coeff[1],lmBoth$coeff[2]),col="red",lwd=3)
abline(c(lmBoth$coeff[1] + lmBoth$coeff[3],lmBoth$coeff[2] +lmBoth$coeff[4]),col="black",lwd=3)

```
